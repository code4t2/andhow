### Join the AndHow Conversation  

There are two ways to ask questions or discuss AndHow:
    
##### The AndHow discussion group  

This is a discussion forum that you can read and post to online or via email. First posts are moderated to avoid spam, 
but responses should be within a day. [>>Join or browse the group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/andhowuser)

##### The AndHow Slack group  

For real-time discussion, the AndHow Slack workgroup makes conversations and collaboration easy. For quick questions or 
more back-and-forth discussions, Slack is a nice solution. To receive an invitation to the AndHow Slack group, fill in 
the form at the bottom of this page.

##### Why Slack?  

Group collaboration software, like Slack, enables real-time discussions and collaboration, and easily lets people defer 
a discussion when they are not available. Slack is free for small groups, is 
[reputable](https://slack.com/customer-stories) and works well.  

Slack is not open source software and 
[some feel that using a closed source tool for an open source project is inappropriate.](https://dave.cheney.net/2017/04/11/why-slack-is-inappropriate-for-open-source-communications) 
Perhaps someday we will switch to an open source collaboration platform, but for today Slack works.
