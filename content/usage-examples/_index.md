All the samples on this page are in the [AndHow Samples project](https://github.com/eeverman/andhow-samples), which you 
can [checkout](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/) from GitHub and run locally. All samples have 
associated tests that highlight testing techniques.  

#### Usage Examples
 - [An application that starts up and loads property values from a main method](../usage-examples/main-startup-example)
 .  This would be a good template to follow for an executable jar.
 - [Load property values from a file on the filesystem](../usage-examples/load-configuration-from-filesystem). Loading 
 from the filesystem is slightly trickier than loading from the classpath because the filesystem varies between 
 environments.
 - [Working with legacy/existing applications that have existing property names](../user-guide/legacy-apps). Its easy 
 to add AndHow into an existing application without having to modify existing code.
